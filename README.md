# weather

This application writed by Java luanguage, and the data from [`Yahoo Weather`](https://weather.yahoo.com/).

It provides 22 countries weather infromation. Including the [`Singapore`](https://weather.yahoo.com/finland/singapore/), [`China`](https://weather.yahoo.com/China), [`Japan`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Japan), [`United States`](https://weather.yahoo.com/United-States), [`India`](https://weather.yahoo.com/India), [`South Korea`](https://weather.yahoo.com/South-Korea), [`Indonesia`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Indonesia), [`Malaysia`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Malaysia), [`France`](https://weather.yahoo.com/France), [`Italy`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Italy), [`Canda`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Canda), [`Mexico`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Mexico), [`Colombia`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Colombia), [`Spain`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Spain), [`Poland`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Poland), [`Russia`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Russia), [`Ireland`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Ireland), [`Egypt`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Egypt), [`Libya`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Libya), [`South Africa`](https://weather.yahoo.com/South-Africa), [`Australia`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Australia), [`Philippines`](https://weather.yahoo.com/Philippines),
and it takes up less CPU resources when it running. 

The weather application will update current city weather information once every half hour.

![Example](https://github.com/Hongten/weather/blob/master/image/cpu_usage.png)

weather need JDK-1.7 or above.

You can get the runable jar file [`weather.jar`](https://github.com/Hongten/weather/blob/master/jar/weather.jar?raw=true) (`~2.46MB`) to run first.

If you run weather applicaiton first time, you may wait a few minutes to get the city code, because the weather application need to parse XML file from [`Yahoo Weather`](https://weather.yahoo.com/) according to the city code.

After you run first time, the country record will be saved in the `c:/weather/weather_country.txt` file and the city code record will be saved in the `c:/weather/weather_code.txt`. The default city is [`Singapore`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/singapore/singapore-1062617/), because weather application was created in `Singapore`.

# Main Panel

The main panel includes `search zone`, `current weather details` and `forcast next three days infromation`.

You can type the city name, and click `Search` button to get the city weather details.

![Example](https://github.com/Hongten/weather/blob/master/image/main_panel.png)

# Show City

`CTRL + M` will open show city panel to show all `countries, provinces, cities`.

![Example](https://github.com/Hongten/weather/blob/master/image/show_city_panel.png)

When you select one city record and double click it, then the weather application will show this city weather detail in the main panel.

If the city(e.g, `imphal, manipur, india`) can not be find, the weather application will inform user as below information.

> How can we get weather details from the [`Yahoo Weather`](https://weather.yahoo.com/)?

First, we need to know the XML file that provided by [`Yahoo Weather`](https://weather.yahoo.com/)

e.g, [http://xml.weather.yahoo.com/forecastrss?u=c&w=1062617](http://xml.weather.yahoo.com/forecastrss?u=c&w=1062617), this URL is get the Singapore weather details.
The important thing is city code(**1062617**).

City name and country name:

```xml
<yweather:location city="Singapore" region="" country="Singapore"/>
```

```

Second, if we get the city code, then we can get the city weather detail.

> How can we get the city code?

We go to the [`Yahoo Weather`](https://weather.yahoo.com/) website : [`https://weather.yahoo.com/`](https://weather.yahoo.com/), and type the city name `singapore` and click `Enter`.

Then we can go to [`https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/singapore/singapore-1062617/`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/singapore/singapore-1062617/), then we get the city code(**1062617**) from URL.

> But...., There are so many cities in the world, How can we get the city code for each city?

We can go to [`https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/) to find that there are all zones(provinces) of `Singapore`.

e.g, [`Central Singapore`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/central-singapore/), [`North East`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/north-east/), [`North West`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/north-west/), [`South East`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/south-east/)

and we select first one [`Central Singapore`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/central-singapore/) and to find that there are all zones(cities) of `Central Singapore`.

e.g, 

[`Bukit Timah`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/north-west/bukit-timah-24703014/) - URL is [`https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/north-west/bukit-timah-24703014/`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/north-west/bukit-timah-24703014/)

[`Singapore`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/singapore/singapore-1062617/) - URL is [`https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/singapore/singapore-1062617/`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/singapore/singapore-1062617/)

We can parse the HTML provided by [`https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/central-singapore/`](https://weather.yahoo.com/singapore/central-singapore/) to get the city code(**24703014**, **1062617**).

> How to prase the HTML string?

You can see the method `getCodeString()` in the [`WeatherUtil.java`](https://github.com/Hongten/weather/blob/master/src/com/b510/weather/util/WeatherUtil.java).
